# lifeTracker

I've decided to create a fun little life app to gamify life in general with the aim of bringing back journaling but maximising the fun and lowering the feeling of having to commit to it.
I also want to brush up my coding skills while I'm at it!

I will think of business cases along the way, but the main features would be to allow the user (me) to log sentences and also mood settings, activities such as fitness related, social skills etc
Achievements will be achieved and the few things that I've thought of for now in terms of data will be saved in a database.
